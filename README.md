GeoFS Auto Airbrakes on Touchdown

A userscript for GeoFS
 that automatically deploys spoilers (airbrakes) when your aircraft touches down and retracts them after takeoff.

Features

Automatically deploys spoilers on wheel touchdown (groundContact detection).

Automatically retracts spoilers after takeoff.

Works with all aircraft in GeoFS.

Lightweight and efficient.

Installation

Install Tampermonkey
 (or another userscript manager).

Create a new script and paste in the code from auto-airbrakes.js
.

Save and reload GeoFS
.

Notes

GeoFS internally calls spoilers “airbrakes,” so the script uses that control name.

Works in both free and Pro versions of GeoFS.

If you spawn already on the runway, the script will not auto-deploy until your first landing.
